       "'Vignette: Patient B is a 45-year-old with leukemia who presents to the emergency room after completing their final cycle of chemotherapy. Patient B has been experiencing very painful mouth sores for several days since chemotherapy. Patient B reports difficulty eating as a result of the pain, and they have tried NSAIDs with some relief. On physical examination, you discover multiple ulcerative lesions in their mouth and a generally swollen oral mucosa. Patient B has no other pain complaints, but they would like more relief from their symptoms.\\nQuestion: Would you offer Patient B intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.\\nAnswer: No.\\nDosage: 1\\nExplanation: Patient B has mucositis and this pain may respond well to non-opioid topical pain medications. It is reasonable to trial these before considering opioids.##\\n\\n'"
