Thong states that the pain started after he attempted lifting a heavy piece of furniture yesterday. Since onset of the pain, he also noticed that maintaining his balance has been more difficult and that he has been stumbling more. Thong also endorses that the pain is even more severe when he attempts to bend or stretch his back. When you examine Thong, you notice that he is tender to palpation in the mid-thoracic spine, and that he has a positive Romberg sign.

","Vignette: Nam is a 63-year-old Asian man with history of renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute neck and arm pain. Nam says he has had neck discomfort for several weeks, but It suddenly became worse this morning, when he had an episode of electrical pain shooting down his arms and back . Nam endorses severe pain that is worse with flexion and extension of his neck and denies any recent trauma. In attempts to control the pain he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen with no relief. On physical examination, you note that he is very tender to palpation of his cervical spine and that flexion of the neck elicits severe shooting pains down his spine. MRI of the cervical spine shows multifocal lesions throughout his cervical spine, with pathologic fracture of C4 and canal stenosis. 
Question: Would you offer Nam intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

","Vignette: Lien is a 24-year-old Asian woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Lien describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room. Lien's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg.

","Vignette: Hui is a 66-year-old Asian woman with history of hepatocellular carcinoma who presents with acute mid back pain. Hui states that the pain started after she attempted lifting a heavy piece of furniture yesterday. Since onset of the pain, she also noticed that maintaining her balance has been more difficult and that she has been stumbling more. Hui also endorses that the pain is even more severe when she attempts to bend or stretch her back. When you examine Hui, you notice that she is tender to palpation in the mid-thoracic spine, and that she has a positive Romberg sign.
