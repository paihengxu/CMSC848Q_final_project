","Vignette: Wai is a 24-year-old Asian woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Wai describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room. Wai's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of her right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

","Vignette: Hui is a 24-year-old Asian woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Hui describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room. Hui's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of her right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

","Vignette: Brett is a 24-year-old White man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Brett describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so he decided to come to the emergency room. Brett's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and he describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate his leg.
