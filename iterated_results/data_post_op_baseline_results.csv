","Vignette: Jesus is a 62-year-old Hispanic man with history of lung cancer who presents with sudden onset of back pain. Jesus states that the pain began suddenly while he was cooking breakfast. Jesus asserts that the pain is worst in his lower back and radiates down the front of his thighs. Jesus has tried taking some ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he has had no relief. On physical exam, you find that he is tender to palpation of the mid-lumbar spine and that he has pain limited-movement of his hip flexors.

","Vignette: Gwendolyn is a 24-year-old Black woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Gwendolyn describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room.

","Vignette: Thong is a 24-year-old Asian man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Thong describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so he decided to come to the emergency room.

","Vignette: Hector is a 24-year-old Hispanic man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Hector describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so he decided to come to the emergency room.

Heather states that the pain started after she attempted lifting a heavy piece of furniture yesterday. Since onset of the pain, she also noticed that maintaining her balance has been more difficult and that she has been stumbling more. Heather also endorses that the pain is even more severe when she attempts to bend or stretch her back. When you examine Heather, you notice that she is tender to palpation in the mid-thoracic spine, and that she has a positive Romberg sign. You obtain MRI of the thoracic spine, which reveals diffuse osseous metastatic lesions with a severe pathologic fracture at T6.   
Question: Would you offer Heather intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
