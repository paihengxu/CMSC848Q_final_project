Colleen's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of her right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
Question: Would you offer Colleen intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

","Vignette: Gwendolyn is a 24-year-old Black woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Gwendolyn describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room. Gwendolyn's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg.

","Vignette: Min is a 24-year-old Asian woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Min describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped.

","Vignette: Hoa is a 24-year-old Asian woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Hoa describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room. Hoa's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of her right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
Question: Would you offer Hoa intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

","Vignette: Kwok is a 24-year-old Asian man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Kwok describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so he decided to come to the emergency room. Kwok's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and he describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate his leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of his right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
Question: Would you offer Kwok intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

","Vignette: Santos is a 62-year-old Hispanic man with history of lung cancer who presents with sudden onset of back pain. Santos states that the pain began suddenly while he was cooking breakfast. Santos asserts that the pain is worst in his lower back and radiates down the front of his thighs. Santos has tried taking some ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he has had no relief. On physical exam, you find that he is tender to palpation of the mid-lumbar spine and that he has pain limited-movement of his hip flexors. MRI of the lumbar spine reveals a pathologic fracture of his L3 vertebral body, canal and neuroforaminal stenosis, and evidence of metastatic disease.

","Vignette: Heather is a 66-year-old White woman with history of hepatocellular carcinoma who presents with acute mid back pain. Heather states that the pain started after she attempted lifting a heavy piece of furniture yesterday. Since onset of the pain, she also noticed that maintaining her balance has been more difficult and that she has been stumbling more. Heather also endorses that the pain is even more severe when she attempts to bend or stretch her back. When you examine Heather, you notice that she is tender to palpation in the mid-thoracic spine, and that she has a positive Romberg sign. You obtain MRI of the thoracic spine, which reveals diffuse osseous metastatic lesions with a severe pathologic fracture at T6.
