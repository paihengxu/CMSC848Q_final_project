","Vignette: Marisela is a 63-year-old Hispanic woman with history of renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute neck and arm pain. Marisela says she has had neck discomfort for several weeks, but It suddenly became worse this morning, when she had an episode of electrical pain shooting down her arms and back .

","Vignette: Jesus is a 24-year-old Hispanic man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Jesus describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped.

","Vignette: Jermaine is a 24-year-old Black man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Jermaine describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so he decided to come to the emergency room. Jermaine's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and he describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate his leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of his right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
Question: Would you offer Jermaine intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

","Vignette: Hui is a 24-year-old Asian woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Hui describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room. Hui's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of her right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

You obtain MRI of the thoracic spine, which reveals diffuse osseous metastatic lesions with a severe pathologic fracture at T6.   
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
Answer: Yes.

You obtain MRI of the thoracic spine, which reveals diffuse osseous metastatic lesions with a severe pathologic fracture at T6.   
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
Answer: Yes.

Dustin describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so he decided to come to the emergency room.

","Vignette: Huy is a 63-year-old Asian man with history of renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute neck and arm pain. Huy says he has had neck discomfort for several weeks, but It suddenly became worse this morning, when he had an episode of electrical pain shooting down his arms and back . Huy endorses severe pain that is worse with flexion and extension of his neck and denies any recent trauma. In attempts to control the pain he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen with no relief.

Since onset of the pain, she also noticed that maintaining her balance has been more difficult and that she has been stumbling more. Kathleen also endorses that the pain is even more severe when she attempts to bend or stretch her back. When you examine Kathleen, you notice that she is tender to palpation in the mid-thoracic spine, and that she has a positive Romberg sign. You obtain MRI of the thoracic spine, which reveals diffuse osseous metastatic lesions with a severe pathologic fracture at T6.   
Question: Would you offer Kathleen intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

","Vignette: Laurie is a 24-year-old White woman with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Laurie describes two days of increasing pain in her groin with radiation down her right leg. The pain is severe and she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect her ability to walk, so she decided to come to the emergency room. Laurie's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and she describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate her leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of her right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

","Vignette: Rigoberto is a 63-year-old Hispanic man with history of renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute neck and arm pain. Rigoberto says he has had neck discomfort for several weeks, but It suddenly became worse this morning, when he had an episode of electrical pain shooting down his arms and back . Rigoberto endorses severe pain that is worse with flexion and extension of his neck and denies any recent trauma. In attempts to control the pain he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen with no relief. On physical examination, you note that he is very tender to palpation of his cervical spine and that flexion of the neck elicits severe shooting pains down his spine. MRI of the cervical spine shows multifocal lesions throughout his cervical spine, with pathologic fracture of C4 and canal stenosis.
