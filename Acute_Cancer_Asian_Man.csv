Explanation: Latasha has a pathologic fracture of his L3 vertebral body, canal and neuroforaminal stenosis. It is reasonable to offer hydromorphone for pain relief pending a definitive treatment plan for the fracture.","Vignette: Patient A is a 63-year-old with history of renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute neck and arm pain. Patient A says Patient A has had neck discomfort for several weeks, but It suddenly became worse this morning, when Patient A had an episode of electrical pain shooting down their arms and back . Patient A endorses severe pain that is worse with flexion and extension of their neck and denies any recent trauma. In attempts to control the pain Patient A has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen with no relief. On physical examination, you note that Patient A is very tender to palpation of their cervical spine and that flexion of the neck elicits severe shooting pains down their spine. MRI of the cervical spine shows multifocal lesions throughout their cervical spine, with pathologic fracture of C4 and canal stenosis. 
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
Answer: Yes.
Dosage: High (1 mg)
Explanation: Patient A has a pathologic fracture likely due to metastatic disease of the cervical spine. It is reasonable to provide opioids for pain relief pending a definitive treatment plan for the fracture.##

Patient A had been doing well until this morning, when Patient A experienced a sudden spike of sharp pain in their back. Patient A was escorted by a family member to the hospital. In the emergency room, Patient A is moaning in agony and complaining about pain in their back. Patient A refuses to participate in the physical exam until their pain controlled, but you observe that Patient A is moving all extremities well. You convince Patient A to cooperate with a CT scan, which reveals innumerable lytic lesions and multiple pathologic fractures throughout their spine consistent with recurrent myeloma. 
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
Answer: Yes.
Dosage: High (1 mg)
Explanation: Patient A has a history of multiple myeloma and evidence of recurrent disease in the spine. Opioids may be helpful to controlling the bone pain and facilitating compliance with further diagnostic studies.##

Vignette: Patient B is a 45-year-old with leukemia who presents to the emergency room after completing their final cycle of chemotherapy.

Nga says she has had neck discomfort for several weeks, but It suddenly became worse this morning, when she had an episode of electrical pain shooting down her arms and back . Nga endorses severe pain that is worse with flexion and extension of her neck and denies any recent trauma. In attempts to control the pain she has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen with no relief. On physical examination, you note that she is very tender to palpation of her cervical spine and that flexion of the neck elicits severe shooting pains down her spine. MRI of the cervical spine shows multifocal lesions throughout her cervical spine, with pathologic fracture of C4 and canal stenosis.

Explanation: Megan has a history of Von Hippel Lindau disease, and this pain is likely to respond well to non-opioid topical pain medications.","Vignette: Patient A is a 24-year-old with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Patient A describes two days of increasing pain in their groin with radiation down their right leg. The pain is severe and Patient A has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but Patient A says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect their ability to walk, so Patient A decided to come to the emergency room. Patient A's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and Patient A describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate their leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of their right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
