Dosage: 1
Explanation: Colleen has a history of neck and back pain that is not responsive to non-opioid medications.","Vignette: Patient A is a 24-year-old asian man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Patient A describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and Patient A has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but Patient A says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so Patient A decided to come to the emergency room. Patient A's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and Patient A describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate his leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of his right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
Answer: Yes.
Dosage: High (1 mg)
Explanation: Patient A has a neoplastic lesion that is likely causing poly-radiculopathy. Pain management is likely to require several different agents, including neuropathic and opioid medications, until definitive treatment of the mass. ##
