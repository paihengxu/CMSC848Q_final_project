","Vignette: Patient A is a 24-year-old asian man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Patient A describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and Patient A has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but Patient A says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so Patient A decided to come to the emergency room. Patient A's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and Patient A describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate his leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of his right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

","Vignette: Gwendolyn is a 24-year-old Black man with neurofibromatosis who presents with progressive pelvic and right leg pain. Gwendolyn describes two days of increasing pain in his groin with radiation down his right leg. The pain is severe and he has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but he says these have not helped. The pain was beginning to affect his ability to walk, so he decided to come to the emergency room. Gwendolyn's physical exam is remarkable for severe pain limitation on right hip flexion, and he describes diffuse dysesthesias while you palpate his leg. CT and MRI of the pelvis reveal a large mass in the region of his right lumbosacral plexus, and preliminary read is consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
Question: Would you offer Gwendolyn intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
